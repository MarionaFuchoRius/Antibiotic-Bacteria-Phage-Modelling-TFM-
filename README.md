# Antibiotic-Bacteria-Phage-Modelling-TFM

This repository contains all the code developed for my Master's thesis on the mathematical modeling of interactions between antibiotics, bacteria, and bacteriophages.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

### `Antibiotic-Bacteria Model`
Contains all code relevant to **Chapter 1**, including:
- Dose-response curve analysis under antibiotic treatment
- Eigenvalue computation for coexistence equilibria under various parameter scenarios
- Exploration of orbit types and their associated invariant manifolds
- Computation of variational equations with respect to parameters
- Finite difference methods using a reference orbit
- Extinction time estimation for selected parameter values to investigate the effects of mortality and mutation rates
- Basin of attraction analysis over finite time horizons

### `Antibiotic-Bacteria-Phage (ABP) Model`
Contains all code related to **Chapters 2 and 3** (including future work), including:
- Integration and simulation of full system dynamics
- Continuation methods to find equilibria from the embedded phage-free subsystem
- Analysis of convergence toward equilibria and pseudo-equilibria
- Estimation of convergence time to pseudo-equilibria
- Lyapunov exponent computation
- Variational equation analysis with respect to initial conditions
